              communicator best known for his work in bringing natural history
              and earth sciences to the public. He has appeared in numerous
              documentaries and is widely recognized as the host of the popular

              work, Sampson has served as a research curator and museum

            <h3>About the lecture</h3>
            <p>
              In his upcoming lecture, Sampson will explore the challenges of
              reconnecting children—and adults—with the natural world. Drawing
              from years of research in paleontology and science education, he
              will share insights on environmental stewardship, scientific
              curiosity, and how ancient life can teach us about the future of
              our planet.
